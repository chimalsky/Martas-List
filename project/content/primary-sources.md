### Manuscript sources

The Emily Dickinson Archive [edickinson.org](https://www.edickinson.org), an open-access site containing digital surrogates of the manuscripts of Dickinson’s poems and letters housed in the Amherst College Archives & Special Collections, the Boston Public Library, and the Houghton Library, Harvard University, is the primary source for the manuscript materials reproduced here. Additional manuscript images have been provided by the following institutions: The American Antiquarian Society, The Beinecke Library, The Forbes Library, The Jones Library, Middlebury College, The Morgan Library, The New York Public Library, Princeton University Library, The Robert P. Esty Library, Scripps College, The State Historical Society of Iowa, and Vassar College. 

### Poem-manuscript data

Data on Dickinson’s poem manuscripts is drawn from archival records and from R. W. Franklin’s _The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Variorum Edition_, 3 vols., Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998. 

### Map Sources

Our map is formed from many maps that have their own stories to tell. 

The Massachusetts map at the heart of this archive was created by Frances A. Henshaw in April 1823. It appears in her “Book of Penmanship,” a slender volume bound in marble boards that shelters, in addition to writing exercises on astronomical geography, her exquisitely hand-drawn and colored maps of nineteen of the then twenty-four United States. Henshaw drew these maps when she was a student at the Middlebury Female Academy, and their fusion of alphabetic and cartographic literacy clearly reflects the influence of Emma Willard, the educator and map-maker who led the Academy from 1807 to 1908. Small in scale—the largest of the State maps is just 26 x 21 cm—Henshaw’s maps function as uncanny mnemonic devices. At least as importantly, they reveal the map as an arrangement of symbols and signs within a system of meaning. Neither wholly objective nor wholly subjective representations of reality, Henshaw’s maps both orient us to the world of 19th-century America and drift out of that world into our own as artifacts from a past that compels interpretation upon interpretation. 

Henshaw’s “Book of Penmanship” is housed in the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection. This Collection, especially its exhibit of 19th-century Maps by Children, has been a rich source of materials for _Dickinson’s Birds_.[1] In addition to Henshaw’s map of Massachusetts, we have used her maps of New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island, as well as a c. 1821 map of the United States drawn by an anonymous student: 

- Frances A. Henshaw, “Massachusetts”, 16 cm (h) x 23 cm (w) (1823)
- Frances A. Henshaw, “New Hampshire”, 26 cm (h) x 21 cm (w) (1823)
- Frances A. Henshaw, “New York”, (1823), 16 cm (h) x 24 cm (w)
- Frances A. Henshaw, “Rhode Island”, 22 cm (h) x 18 cm (w) (1823)
- Anonymous Student, “United States”, 51 cm (h) x 81 cm (w) (1821)

### Bird-sound and sonogram sources

The website [xeno-canto.org](https://www.xeno-canto.org) (“Xeno-canto”), created in 2005 by Bob Planque and William-Pier Vellinga, and administrated by the Netherlands-based Xeno-canto foundation (Stichting Xeno-canto voor natuurgeluiden), is an open-access site dedicated to sharing recordings of sounds of wild birds from all across the world and the source of the sound and sonogram files used in Dickinson’s Birds. Xeno-canto is committed to education, conservation, and science, and their recordings are shared under various Creative Commons licenses that generally allow distribution provided recordists are credited and provided no commercial proceeds are sought. In phases two and three of this project, we plan to include sound data collected in Amherst, Massachusetts. 

In addition to the sound and sonogram files provided by xeno.canto, _Dickinson’s Birds_ will host sound and sonogram files sent by individual user-contributors. 

### Bird data

Data on Dickinson’s birds has been sifted from a number of different sources both historical and contemporary.

- Nineteenth-century data on the birds’ occurrence, arrival, and departure dates is drawn principally from H. L. Clark’s _The Birds of Amherst & Vicinity, including nearly the whole of Hampshire County_ (1887), originally published in Amherst, Mass., by J. E. Williams and now available via the HathiTrust @ [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044072249964&view=1up&seq=1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044072249964&view=1up&seq=1). In cases where data is not available in Clark, two additional sources—Ebenezer Emmons’s _Birds of Massachusetts_ (1833), originally published in Dr. Edward Hitchcock’s “Report on the Geology, Minerology, Botany and Zoology of Massachusetts”, pp. 528-51 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/81275#page/534/mode/1up](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/81275#page/534/mode/1up) and J. A. Allen’s “Catalogue of the Birds Found at Springfield, Mass., with Notes on their Migrations, Habits, & c., together with a list of those birds found in the State not yet observed at Springfield”, originally published in the _Proceedings of the Essex Institute at Salem_, Vol. IV, No. 2, September 1864 (HathiTrust: [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3508284&view=1up&seq=266&q1=Birds%20of%20Springfield](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3508284&view=1up&seq=266&q1=Birds%20of%20Springfield)) have helped us to fill in the record. 

- Twentieth-century data on the birds’ occurrence, arrival, and departure dates has been drawn from Aaron Clark Bagg and Samuel Atkins Eliot Jr.’s _Birds of the Connecticut Valley in Massachusetts_ (1937), originally published in Northampton, Mass., by The Hampshire Bookshop and available through the HathiTrust at [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924000062475&view=1up&seq=1](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924000062475&view=1up&seq=1)

- Twenty-first-century data on the birds’ occurrence, arrival, and departure dates derives from several sources: Massachusetts Avian Records Committee State List @ [http://maavianrecords.com/official-state-list/](http://maavianrecords.com/official-state-list/); Mass Audubon @ [https://www.massaudubon.org](https://www.massaudubon.org) and the Mass Audubon Breeding Bird Atlas 1 Species Accounts @ [https://www.massaudubon.org/our-conservation-work/wildlife-research-conservation/statewide-bird-monitoring/breeding-bird-atlases/bba1/find-a-bird/](https://www.massaudubon.org/our-conservation-work/wildlife-research-conservation/statewide-bird-monitoring/breeding-bird-atlases/bba1/find-a-bird/); the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology @ [allaboutbirds.org](http://allaboutbirds.org) and Birds of the World @ https://birdsoftheworld.org; and Wayne R. Petersen and Brian E. Small’s Field Guide to _Birds of Massachusetts_ published by Scott & Nix, Inc., 2017.

- Data on habitat and nest materials has been gathered from the _National Audubon Society Field Guide to the Birds: Eastern Region_ (1994) and the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology [allaboutbirds.org](http://allaboutbirds.org). Clark’s (1887) notes on bird nests have also been incorporated into the archive. 

- Data on the conservation status of Dickinson’s birds in our century is readily available. Here, our first source is the Cornell Lab of Ornithology [allaboutbirds.org](http://allaboutbirds.org). More local records, however, often deepen our understanding of the birds’ conservation status in meaningful ways, and we plan to supplement the general information provided by Cornell with information from these records. The American Bird Conservancy is another important source for 21st-century environmental data, especially data on the specific threats facing birds. Data regarding the conservation status of Dickinson’s birds in the twentieth century is recoverable through the documentation provided in the Christmas Bird Censuses, first begun in 1900 by ornithologist Frank M. Chapman and then carried on throughout the century. The conservation status of Dickinson’s birds in the 19th-century is often unreported or simply unknown. One aim of Dickinson’s Birds is to begin to fill in this important but largely blank record.
